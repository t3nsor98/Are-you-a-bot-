# Bot Detector

Bot Detector is a simple React application that allows users to determine if they are interacting with a bot. The application displays a question "Are you a Bot???" along with options to answer "Yes" or "No". Upon clicking "No", the application generates funny phrases suggesting the possibility of the user being a bot.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/t3nsor98/Are-you-a-bot-.git

   cd Are-you-a-bot-
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash

   ```

5. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
